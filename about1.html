<center><h1>OUR JOURNEY!</h1>
<p class="intro"><br/><br/>The setting of our origin story: curbside at lunch hour.</br> 
Every day for 16 years, our team of chefs on wheels would cruise into our parking spot,</br> 
assemble the goods, and lean out the window with culinary comfort for the hungry people waiting outside.</br> 
Year after year, our innovations and word-of-mouth won us more customers.</br>  
Lunch hour got crazy! Still, local regulations prohibited our burgeoning business from setting up outdoor table.</br> 
Our hands were tied when we tried to meet the increased demand for our food. Until we turned to software. </br> 

Our point of sale software was the solution we needed to turn our food truck into a restaurant.</br> 
Agility is the same trait that has led us through the challenges of the pandemic.</br>  
Relying on our online platform for collecting orders and communicating with customers,</br> 
 we have maintained our existing location and have looked after existing employees.</br> 
What is more, we have purchased a second location and hired more talent to join our team.</br>  Let us enable you to do the same.
